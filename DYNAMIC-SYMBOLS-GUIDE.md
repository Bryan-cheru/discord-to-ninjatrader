- ✅ **No configuration changes needed** - system auto-detects symbols
- ✅ **Load new symbols anytime** - they're instantly available
- ✅ **Intelligent error handling** for invalid symbols

## 🔧 RESTART INSTRUCTIONS:

### Step 1: Restart NT8 Strategy
1. Open **NinjaTrader 8**
2. Go to **Control Center > New > Strategy...**
3. Find **"DiscordTradeCopier"** in the strategy list
4. **IMPORTANT**: Update "Tradable Instruments" to: `NQ,ES,MNQ,MES,YM,RTY,CL,GC`
5. Click **"Start Strategy"**
6. Look for this message in Output window:
   ```
   ✅ TCP listener started successfully on port 36971
   🎯 Strategy now supports ANY symbol that's loaded in NinjaTrader!
   ```

### Step 2: Test Dynamic Symbol Support
1. Run: `node test-dynamic-symbols.js`
2. Check which symbols are automatically detected
3. Add more symbols to charts if needed

---

## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS:

### Automatic Symbol Detection:
- Strategy scans **ALL loaded data series** in NinjaTrader
- Maps them automatically to be Discord-tradeable
- No manual configuration required!

### Adding New Symbols:
1. **Add symbol to any chart** in NinjaTrader
2. **OR** add to Market Analyzer/watchlist
3. **OR** include in strategy's "Tradable Instruments"
4. Symbol is **instantly available** for Discord trading!

### Discord Commands (Examples):
```
BUY 1 NQ        # Trade Nasdaq (if loaded)
BUY 1 CL        # Trade Crude Oil (if loaded)  
BUY 1 GC        # Trade Gold (if loaded)
BUY 1 6E        # Trade Euro (if loaded)
SELL 2 ES       # Trade S&P 500 (if loaded)
CLOSE CL        # Close Oil positions
CLOSE POSITION  # Close all positions
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Symbol Not Working?
1. **Check if symbol is loaded**: Look at NT8 charts/watchlists
2. **Check strategy logs**: Output window shows detected symbols
3. **Add symbol**: Open chart for that symbol in NT8
4. **Restart strategy**: If symbol was just added

### Expected Log Messages:
```
📊 DYNAMIC INSTRUMENT DISCOVERY: Scanning all loaded data series...
📈 AUTO-MAPPED: NQ → index 0
📈 AUTO-MAPPED: ES → index 1
📈 AUTO-MAPPED: CL → index 2
✅ DYNAMIC MAPPING COMPLETE: 8 instruments ready for trading
🎯 Strategy now supports ANY symbol that's loaded in NinjaTrader!
```
